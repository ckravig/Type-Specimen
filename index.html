                IBM Plex™ is an international typeface family designed by Mike Abbink, IBM BX&D, in collaboration 
                with Bold Monday, an independent Dutch type foundry. Plex was designed to capture IBM’s spirit and 
                history, and to illustrate the unique relationship between mankind and machine—a principal theme for 
                IBM since the turn of the century.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The result is a neutral, yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that 
                includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, Serif, and several other styles for several languages, and has 
                excellent legibility in print, web and mobile interfaces. Plex’s three designs work well independently, 
                and even better together. 
            </p>
            
            <p> 
                Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial 
                storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics 
                give you even more options for your designs.

                Research has been a part of IBM since its founding, and its organized efforts trace their roots back to 1945, when the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory was founded at Columbia University in New York City, converting a renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side into IBM's first laboratory. Now, IBM Research constitutes the largest industrial research organization in the world, with 12 labs on 6 continents.[143] IBM Research is headquartered at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York, and facilities include the Almaden lab in California, Austin lab in Texas, Australia lab in Melbourne, Brazil lab in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, China lab in Beijing and Shanghai, Ireland lab in Dublin, Haifa lab in Israel, India lab in Delhi and Bangalore, Tokyo lab, Zurichlab and Africa lab in Nairobi.

                IBM is nicknamed Big Blue in part due to its blue logo and color scheme,[158][159] and also partially since IBM once had a de facto dress code of white shirts with blue suits.[158][160] The company logo has undergone several changes over the years, with its current "8-bar" logo designed in 1972 by graphic designer Paul Rand.[161] It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo, since period photocopiers did not render narrow (as opposed to tall) stripes well. Aside from the logo, IBM used Helvetica as a corporate typeface for 50 years, until it was replaced in 2017 by the custom-designed IBM Plex.

                IBM has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996, IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the Masters Tournament, one of the four major championships in professional golf, with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course cam (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the United States for a major sporting event (2016).[162] As a result, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty became the third female member of the Master's governing body, the Augusta National Golf Club.[163] IBM is also a major sponsor in professional tennis, with engagements at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the Australian Open, and the French Open.[164] The company also sponsored the Olympic Games from 1960 to 2000,[165] and the National Football League from 2003 to 2012.[166]
