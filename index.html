                IBM Plex™ is an international typeface family designed by Mike Abbink, IBM BX&D, in collaboration 
                with Bold Monday, an independent Dutch type foundry. Plex was designed to capture IBM’s spirit and 
                history, and to illustrate the unique relationship between mankind and machine—a principal theme for 
                IBM since the turn of the century.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The result is a neutral, yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that 
                includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, Serif, and several other styles for several languages, and has 
                excellent legibility in print, web and mobile interfaces. Plex’s three designs work well independently, 
                and even better together. 
            </p>
            
            <p> 
                Use the Sans as a contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial 
                storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly expressive nature of the italics 
                give you even more options for your designs.

                Research has been a part of IBM since its founding, and its 
                organized efforts trace their roots back to 1945, when the Watson 
                Scientific Computing Laboratory was founded at Columbia University 
                in New York City, converting a renovated fraternity house on 
                Manhattan's West Side into IBM's first laboratory. Now, IBM 
                Research constitutes the largest industrial research organization 
                in the world, with 12 labs on 6 continents. IBM Research is 
                headquartered at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York, 
                and facilities include the Almaden lab in California, Austin lab in 
                Texas, Australia lab in Melbourne, Brazil lab in São Paulo and Rio 
                de Janeiro, China lab in Beijing and Shanghai, Ireland lab in 
                Dublin, Haifa lab in Israel, India lab in Delhi and Bangalore, 
                Tokyo lab, Zurichlab and Africa lab in Nairobi.

                    <strong>IBM</strong> is nicknamed Big Blue in part due to its blue logo and 
                    color scheme, and also partially since IBM once had a de facto 
                    dress code of white shirts with blue suits. The company logo 
                    has undergone several changes over the years, with its current 
                    "8-bar" logo designed in 1972 by graphic designer Paul Rand. 
                    It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo, since period 
                    photocopiers did not render narrow (as opposed to tall) stripes 
                    well. Aside from the logo, IBM used Helvetica as a corporate 
                    typeface for 50 years, until it was replaced in 2017 by the 
                    custom-designed

                    <u><i>IBM</i></u> has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of 
                    operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996, IBM has been 
                    the exclusive technology partner for the Masters Tournament, 
                    one of the four major championships in professional golf, with 
                    IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course 
                    cam (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), 
                    and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the 
                    United States for a major sporting event (2016). As a result, 
                    IBM CEO Ginni Rometty became the third female member of the 
                    Master's governing body, the Augusta National Golf Club.
                    <!-- IBM is also a major sponsor in professional tennis, with 
                    engagements at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the Australian Open, 
                    and the French Open.The company also sponsored the 
                    Olympic Games from 1960 to 2000, and the National Football 
                    League from 2003 to 2012. -->

                The IBM Rome Software Lab (formerly known as IBM Tivoli Rome Laboratory) is 
                one of the largest software development laboratories in Italy, and one of the 
                largest IBM Software Group Labs in Europe.
                Founded in 1978, the Rome Lab (located in Rome) now has more than 550 
                professionals among software developers, project managers, IT specialists, 
                and IT architects. The main mission of the Rome Lab is focused on IBM Tivoli 
                development, including Tivoli Configuration Manager, Tivoli Remote Control, 
                ivoli Workload Scheduler, and Tivoli Monitoring.
                In 2004, the laboratory focused on the adoption of the IBM Rational Unified 
                Process (RUP) in Tivoli and in the wider Software Group inside IBM. In 2007, 
                IBM opened the "Rome SOA Leadership Center" hosted by and formed with a team of 
                experts on service-oriented architecture (SOA) coming from the IBM Rome Software 
                Laboratory. The Rome laboratory constantly collaborates with Italian 
                Universities and Research Centers.
                In 2011, IBM became the first technology company Warren Buffett's 
                holding company Berkshire Hathaway invested in. Initially he bought 
                64 million shares costing 10.5 billion dollars. Over the years he 
                increased his IBM holdings however he reduced it by 94.5% to 2.05 
                million shares at the end of 2017. By May 2018 he was completely 
                out of IBM.
